# Card-Caster-Web
## Overview
Card-Caster-Web is an illustrative web application that demonstrates
card animations, designed to complement the React Native app [card-caster-go](https://github.com/usichenko-nikita/card-caster-go).
The distinctiveness of this app lies in its use of playing card images, which are uniquely generated by DALL-E, 
an AI that creates amazing images with artifacts:)
